This cpp file is for what is there in this project, therefore every users, who like to learn C++, can understand what is happening in this application.

Notes
+ The lines, headings in uppercase and many newlines before the headings for each task are included for the organization of the program as well as for the user-friendliness of this application.
+ cout object that stands for Console Output is used to produce output in this entire project. For example, cout<<"Hello World"; produces the output "Hello world" with << arrow for the sign of cout.
+ cin object that stands for Console Input is used within this entire project to allow the user to input. For example, cin>>age allows the user to input the age.
+ C++ manipulator endl or '\n' are available to insert a newline. Eg:- cout<<"I am Jack"<<endl<<"I am 19 years" produces as shown below:
					I am Jack
					I am 19 years
+ This programming is object-oriented for the modularity, reusability and expandability, hence large software projects can be splitted into smaller projects  or developed from existing programming.
+ If, else if and else place is mostly implemented for True or False on the condition. 
+ Header files are always there to contain declaration.
+ There are two types of header files: 
	 1. Pre-existing header files- Files that are available in the compiler and we just need to import them.
	 2. User-defined header files- Files that are defined by the programmers and can be imported using #include with an extension .h. Eg:- include "Word.h".  
+ rand() function is used to generate random number from 0.
+ STL containers used in this project are vectors as they can change their sizes during runtime.
+ iostream header file stands for input-output system containing objects like cout, cin, cerr, and many more.
+ fstream file deals with input or output with files.
+ srand(time(NULL)) function is making use of the computer's internal clock to manipulate the choice of the seed. Here, NULL means the value in seconds is not stored yet.
+ random_shuffle() shuffles every STL containers in any positions from the beginning and end of their sizes.
+ clear() in vector is used to erase all elements presented in it.
+ push_back() adds an element into the vector.
+ find(container.begin(),container.end(), required element) searches for the required element in vector.
+ size_t is a type to represent any object's size in bytes.
+ The cctype header file declares a set of functions to classify and change every characters.
+ The algorithm header file shows a collection of functions designed to be used on ranges of elements. Example:-sort(), reverse().
+ *max_element(container.begin(), container.end()) determines the maximum element from the vector.
+ A namespace is a declarative region that provides an idea to the identifiers such as the names of types, functions, variables, and many more.
+ Overriding function allows the child class to modify the parent class's functions. As an example FindWord() is an overrided function for Dictionary_Part02 class.
+ length() function determines the size of the data.
